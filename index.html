        <p>My name is Tesfa Bizuneh. I am a student at UNC Bootcamp. I am very excited and ready to change my life. I am currently working for a Biopharmaceutical company and I am planning to change my career because my goal is to become a valued professional programmer.</p>
        <p> I am a responsible and a hard-working student. I enjoy my time at the bootcamp: it is very enjoyable to practice coding and learn new things every time; the students, the TAs and the Instructor are very friendly and ready to help. I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very eager student which I believe is my strength. I am looking forward to complet the course successfully.</p>
